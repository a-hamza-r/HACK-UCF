To learn more about the php strcmp function, I looked at the above link. It mentions that strcmp returns NULL + a warning when comparing different types of parameters. 
NULL is equivalent to 0, which is also the output when strings being compared are equal.
Since, I cannot directly input an integer (because it will be recognized as a string by browser - may be there is an easy way but I do not know), I input the `passwd` field as an array like in this request:
    ctf.hackucf.org:4000/cmp/cmp.php?passwd[]=test
This results in printing out the password and giving a warning. 
Password is the flag:
    flag{php_is_really_really_well_designed}
