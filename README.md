This repository shows my attempt on solving challenges for a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competition held at *https://ctf.hackucf.org/* called **HACK UCF**. My username is *hamzzza*. I mainly solved challenges in the tracks *Pwn*, *Web*, *RE (Reverse Engineering)*, and *Crypto*, based on the knowledge gathered from the course *Computer Security* course at Florida State University (FSU), and participating in the competition is a requirement for the assignment in the course. By no means this serves as a manual for learning how to solve **CTF** problems, but just an attempt based on my limited understanding of security exploits. I hope this helps others reason better about the **CTF** challenges, rather than providing the standard way of solving these issues. 

Each of the directories *Pwn*, *Web*, *RE*, *Crypto* include subdirectories for the tasks solved or at least partially attempted with partial results. Many of the subdirectories will include a binary programs and sometimes C programs (common for *Pwn* and *RE* tracks), weblinks (common for *Web* track), files containing encryption/decryption related information (common for *Crypto* track), and almost all subdirectories include a python script called *exploit.py* that allows automated attack to help capture the flags. Further files provide some insights and partial results showing how the task was done or at least attempted. In the main directory, there is a file called *instructions.pdf* that is an informal document containing information about how I went about reasoning about each problem, which by no means should be considered an official way to solve such problems. 

Hope you are able to gain insights from these solved instances :)
